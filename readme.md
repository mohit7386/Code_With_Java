Java :-
Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language. It is a General purpose programming language...Java Code can Run Everywhere on any system it follows WORA(Write once run everywhere).It Generates the byte code the compiled code where it is portable you can run on any system without recompiling the program..
java is both Compiled and Interpreted language..

Java is not a Pure Object oriented programming language Why??

Pure Object Oriented Language or Complete Object Oriented Language are Fully Object Oriented Language which supports or have features which treats everything inside program as objects. It doesnâ€™t support primitive datatype(like int, char, float, bool, etc.). There are seven qualities to be satisfied for a programming language to be pure Object Oriented. They are:

Encapsulation/Data Hiding
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
All predefined types are objects
All user defined types are objects
All operations performed on objects must be only through methods exposed at the objects.

Platform:- Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

Simple.java -> Sample example of Java Code 

class Simple{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
     System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }  
}  
Class name and file name should be same in java...It is Mandatory to same name

Four types of applications we can create with java language :-

1) Standalone Application:-

Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.

2) Web Application:-

An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.

3) Enterprise Application:-

An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

4) Mobile Application:-

An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.

java is Secured Why??

Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:

1) No explicit pointer
2) Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
3) Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically.
4) Bytecode Verifier: It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
Security Manager: It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.
