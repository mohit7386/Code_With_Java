Java :-
Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language. It is a General purpose programming language...Java Code can Run Everywhere on any system it follows WORA(Write once run everywhere).It Generates the byte code the compiled code where it is portable you can run on any system without recompiling the program..
java is both Compiled and Interpreted language..

Java is not a Pure Object oriented programming language Why??

Pure Object Oriented Language or Complete Object Oriented Language are Fully Object Oriented Language which supports or have features which treats everything inside program as objects. It doesnâ€™t support primitive datatype(like int, char, float, bool, etc.). There are seven qualities to be satisfied for a programming language to be pure Object Oriented. They are:

Encapsulation/Data Hiding
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
All predefined types are objects
All user defined types are objects
All operations performed on objects must be only through methods exposed at the objects.

Platform:- Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

Simple.java -> Sample example of Java Code 

class Simple{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
     System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }  
}  
Class name and file name should be same in java...It is Mandatory to same name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Four types of applications we can create with java language :-

1) Standalone Application:-

Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.

2) Web Application:-

An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.

3) Enterprise Application:-

An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

4) Mobile Application:-

An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.

Features of java :-

Portable
Robust 
Multithreaded
Secured 
Platform Independent
Dynamic

java is Secured Why??

Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:

1) No explicit pointer
2) Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
3) Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically.
4) Bytecode Verifier: It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
Security Manager: It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.

What is JDK and JRE?
JDK:- Java Development Kit is a Collection of tools used for developing and running java programs..
JRE:- Java Runtime Environment helps in executing the program which is developed in java...

Why Java is robust?

The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because:

1)It uses strong memory management.
2)There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
3)Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.

More About Java :-
Java doesn't Support Operator Overloading but C++ Does...
1) Java uses both compiler and interpreter. Java source code is converted into bytecode at compilation time.The interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and produces output.
2) Java supports call by value only. There is no call by reference in java.
3) Java doesn't support structures and unions.
4) Java has built-in thread support.
5) Java does not support header files like C++. Java uses the import keyword to include different classes and methods.

Source code Information:-
1) class keyword is used to declare a class in Java.

2) public keyword is an access modifier that represents visibility. It means it is visible to all.

) static is a keyword. If we declare any method as static, it is known as the static method. The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method. The main() method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't require creating an object to invoke the main() method. So, it saves memory.

4) void is the return type of the method. It means it doesn't return any value.

5) main represents the starting point of the program.

6) String[] args or String args[] is used for command line argument. We will discuss it in coming section.

7) System.out.println() is used to print statement. Here, System is a class, out is an object of the PrintStream class, println() is a method of the PrintStream class. We will discuss the internal working of System.out.println() statement in the coming section.

What happens at runtime in java?
Following steps are performed :-
Source code Converted it into a class file by the compilation process and the steps shown below-
1) Class File
2) ClassLoader
3) Bytecode Verified
4) Interpreter
5) Runtime
6) Hardware

Classloader: It is the subsystem of JVM that is used to load class files.

Bytecode Verifier: Checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.

Interpreter: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.

Which of the following operations JVM perform?

The JVM performs following operations:-->

1) Loads code
2) Verifies code
3) Executes code 
4)Provides runtime environment
